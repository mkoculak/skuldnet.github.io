Medical Research Council Clinician Scientist. Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL.

I am a clinical-academic an honorary consultant in Neurology, with expertise in Neuroimaging and Movement Disorders. My work focuses on how differences in brain anatomy contribute to the variability between individuals in health and disease. I have developed a collection of advanced imaging techniques to better define subcortical and brainstem anatomy at an individual subject level. I have also developed ways to map anatomical patterns of disease heterogeneity, and combine clinical-genetic-imaging datasets to predict future complications.

Research interests:
- Computational Anatomy & Phenotyping
– Image segmentation
– Interindividual variability
– Neurodegeneration
- Precision medicine
