Senior Lecturer and Head of Physics. Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL.

I am an MRI Physicist with expertise in quantitative imaging of brain microstructure and the linking of this information with function and behaviour.  A key part of my work is the development of measurement techniques (pulse sequences to run on MRI scanners), which enable researchers to get rich information that describe the organisation and workings of the human brain, and the development of models that extract specific tissue properties from the acquired data.

Research interests:
- Quantitative microstructural imaging of the human brain
– Modelling of tissue properties
– Evaluating interindividual variability
– Exploring clinical conditions such as neurodegeneration
- Functional imaging
